# Bioinformatics: Talking to NCBI with Python and R

This notebook demonstrates how to interact with NCBI databases (such as PubMed and Nucleotide) using both Python and R. It provides side-by-side code examples and explanations for each language.

## Contents
- How to install required libraries (BioPython, rentrez, rpy2)
- How to search and fetch data from NCBI databases
- Equivalent code for each operation in both Python and R

## How to Use
1. Run the first cell to install all required packages.
2. For R code execution, make sure the rpy2 extension is enabled in Jupyter.
3. Each section is marked with a colored heading: Python (blue/yellow) and R (blue).
4. Run the code cells in order to see the results and compare outputs.

If you encounter errors during installation or execution, ensure you have an active internet connection and that both Python and R are properly installed on your system.

Enjoy exploring bioinformatics with Python and R!
